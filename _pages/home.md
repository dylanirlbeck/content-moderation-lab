**Ethical Moderation** is a programming project that forces students to grapple with the ethics of content moderation. The
project was built for students, by students, and it is designed to be open-source: we want to be part of a larger wave of revamped ethics education in computer science.

We encourage instructors to incorporate this lab into their course; we challenge students to improve their ethical
capacities by engaging with the project’s material; and, more broadly, we welcome anyone curious or concerned with content
moderation to think critically about how it can and should be done.

This project is open to and encourages feedback. The [lab](https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/hackillinois-2021) and [website](https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/content-moderation-lab) code is open-source, and we (the project’s creators) [welcome emails](https://dylanirlbeck.github.io/ethical-moderation/acknowledgements/).

Without further ado, we present: [Ethical Moderation](https://dylanirlbeck.github.io/ethical-moderation/project).
