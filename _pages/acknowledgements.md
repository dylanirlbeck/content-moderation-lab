# Acknowledgements

This project was originally built at [HackIllinois 2021](https://hackillinois.org/) by Prashant, Sahan, and Dylan. We
were mentored by Ryan Cunningham, a lecturer at the University of Illinois.

We want to thank the staff for putting on such a well-run, virtual event, and we
especially want to thank our mentor, Ryan, for encouraging us to
pursue this work at a hackathon.

## Related Work

This project, and our larger ethics initiative at the University of Illinois,
was inspired by countless researchers and advocates at other universities. Here
are just of the people and work we've drawn upon:

- [Embedded EthiCS](https://embeddedethics.seas.harvard.edu/)
- [Casey Fiesler](https://caseyfiesler.com/), and in particular her paper,[ _Integrating Ethics into Introductory Programming Classes_ ](https://cmci.colorado.edu/~cafi5706/SIGCSE2021_IntegratingEthics.pdf)
