# About

Over the last decade, computer science programs across the world have had to face the question: are we training ethically-competent
computer scientists? The need for ethics training in computer science curricula is, of course, unquestionable. Seemingly every day,
there are new controversies caused by technologies, technology companies, and/or technologists. But teaching ethics is necessarily
difficult, and it is especially so for a field that has only recently begun to grapple with its impact on society.

At the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), ethics is currently delivered through a standalone course,
[Ethics & Professional Issues](https://cs.illinois.edu/academics/courses/cs210), which is required for all engineering majors. This course begins with an introduction
to ethical philosophy and logical argumentation, then proceeds to discuss topics such as privacy, professional ethics,
and intellectual property. These topics are taught primarily through lectures and discussion sections. Weekly essays
are also assigned to have students think critically about the topics at hand and explicate their perspectives in writing.

But what became clear to Ryan Cunningham, the professor for CS210 (and our mentor), was that students felt a disconnect between the highly-technical
content of their core CS classes and the non-technical structure of their lone ethics course. In other words, there existed a
noticeable gap between CS210 and the rest of the curriculum. Ryan sought to remedy this, and over time he introduced two programming-based
labs -- in data ethics and security vulnerabilities -- that have, what we are calling, emergent properties. Emergent properties are
learnings that reveal themselves gradually, and at different times for every student. For example, the data ethics lab teaches students
how one could naively build a racist AI without knowing; the emergent property in this case would be, of course, the danger of biased
training data in machine learning. These properties are a unique feature of programming-based ethics assignments, allowing students
to establish the technical connections necessary to approach their work as computer scientists through an ethical lens. To this end,
a recent paper, Integrating Ethics into Introductory Programming Classes, demonstrates the value of embedding ethics into programming
assignments.

As undergraduates, we felt strongly that programming-based ethics is a powerful way to learn about ethical dilemmas in computing.
And so, we sought out to introduce a new programming assignment into CS210, focused on the ethics of content moderation.

**Ethical Moderation** is a programming-based ethics assignment for students, by students. The project is
completely open-source by design: we want to be part of a larger wave of revamped ethics education in computer science.
We encourage instructors to incorporate this lab into their course; we challenge students to improve their ethical
capacities by engaging with the project’s material; and, more broadly, we welcome anyone curious or concerned with content
moderation to think hard about how it can and should be done.

This project is open to and encourages feedback. The [lab](https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/hackillinois-2021) and [website](https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/content-moderation-lab) code is open-source, and we (the project’s creators) welcome emails.

Without further ado, we present: [Ethical Moderation](https://dylanirlbeck.github.io/ethical-moderation/project).
