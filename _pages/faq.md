# FAQ

We anticipate that you have questions. Here are some that may come to mind; if
you have others, please [let us know!](https://dylanirlbeck.github.io/ethical-moderation/contact/)

- **Why did you not use real Facebook/Twitter data?**
  - As we were constructing this assignment, we had to consider what was most appropriate for our audience. At a
    university, and especially at a large one like UIUC, students come from all walks of life. A significant portion
    of the content on Facebook -- and particularly the types of posts weâ€™d need to include in our dataset -- would likely
    be extremely graphic, offensive, or both. We concluded that in order to provide all students with an optimal and safe
    learning experience, we should aim for our dataset and assignment to be neutral, while still being as illustrative as
    possible. We hope that we achieve this balance, but if you feel there is a different way we could set up the assignment,
    please let us know!

- **How did you gather the project data?**
  - The data is pulled from Reddit, specifically from the subreddits r/sports and r/politics. To
    create the dataset, we merged a subset of posts from each subreddit
    together, assigning on-topic labels for the posts from r/sports and
    off-topic labels to the posts from r/politics. As mentioned earlier, there
    are a number of interesting posts that may be labeled as off-topic, but may
    actually be on-topic for _SportIt_(and vice-versa for posts labeled as
    on-topic) -- it is our hope that students see
    these interesting patterns and think critically about the effects of
    either removing posts from a platform or not.
