If you'd like to get in touch about this project, we welcome emails!

This project was originally built at [HackIllinois 2021](https://hackillinois.org/). We
were mentored by [Ryan Cunningham](https://cs.illinois.edu/about/people/all-faculty/rcunnin2),
a lecturer at the University of Illinois.

We want to thank the staff for putting on such a well-run, virtual event, and we
especially want to thank Ryan for encouraging us to rigorously pursue this work.
