# ethical-moderation

**Ethical Moderation** is a programming project that forces students to grapple with the ethics of content moderation. The project was built for students, by students, and it is designed to be open-source: we want to be part of a larger wave of revamped ethics education in computer science.

We encourage instructors to incorporate this lab into their course; we challenge students to improve their ethical capacities by engaging with the projectâ€™s material; and, more broadly, we welcome anyone curious or concerned with content moderation to think critically about how it can and should be done.
