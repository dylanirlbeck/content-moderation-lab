# ethical-moderation

**Ethical Moderation** is a programming project that forces students to grapple with the ethics of content moderation. The project was built for students, by students, and it is designed to be open-source: we want to be part of a larger wave of revamped ethics education in computer science.

This repository houses the website code. The site was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and we used the [al-folio template](https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio) as a base.

If you're looking for the project code, you can be found [here](https://github.com/dylanirlbeck/ethical-moderation-lab).
